            <p class="introText">At Re-Plate, we are on a mission to make a difference. Our initiative focuses on saving surplus food from events and ensuring it reaches those in need. With the simple act of donating excess food, we're not just preventing wastage; we're nurturing a community where no one goes hungry. Through the collaborative efforts of donors, NGOs, and caring individuals, we've fostered a healthier and more compassionate society. With every plate saved, we are not only feeding empty stomachs but also nourishing the spirit of unity and empathy. Join us in our journey to make a lasting impact, one plate at a time.</p>
